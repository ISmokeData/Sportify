# Sportify: AI That Knows Your Game

ðŸš€ **Welcome to the Sports Classification Project!**  
This project uses **deep learning** to classify images of various sports activities. Whether it's a thrilling game of baseball, the intensity of arm wrestling, or the elegance of balance beam routines, this model can identify and categorize the sport in an image with remarkable accuracy.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Image Classification**: Predicts the sport from an uploaded image.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using **PyTorch** and a pre-trained **ResNet50** architecture.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for easy interaction.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Supports classification of multiple sports (e.g., archery, baseball, hockey, etc.).

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Upload an Image**: Users can upload an image of a sports activity.
2. **Model Prediction**: The deep learning model processes the image and predicts the sport.
3. **Display Results**: The predicted sport is displayed along with the uploaded image.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyTorch**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web interface.
- **Torchvision**: For image preprocessing and transformations.
- **Pillow**: For image handling.
